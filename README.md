## Tests ðŸ”¦

There is a specific test folder for you to test the dependencies, the bot and if everything is set up correctly. To do that I recommend,
running below codes,

1. Go to the tests folder run `python3 setupTests.py` this will output if Python,pip,selenium,dotenv and Firefox are installed correctly on your system.
2. Run `python3 seleniumTest.py` this will output if the Selenium and gecko driver is able to retrieve data from a website. If it returns an error make sure you have correctly installed selenium and gecko driver
3. Run `python3 linkedinTest.py` this will try to log in automatically to your Linkedin account based on the path you defined in the .env file. If its giving an error make sure the path exists and you created firefox profile, logged in manually to your Linkedin account once.
   Here is the result you should get after running test files,

## How to Set up (long old way) ðŸ› 

This tutorial briefly explains how to set up LinkedIn Easy Apply jobs bot. With few modifications you can make your own bot or try my other bots for other platforms.

1. Install Firefox or Chrome. I was using Firefox for this so I will continue the usage of it on Firefox browser. Process would be similar on Chrome too.
2. Install Python.
3. Download [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) put it in Pythonâ€™s installation folder.
4. Install pip, python get-pip.py
5. Install selenium pip install selenium
6. Clone the code
7. Create a profile on Firefox, about:profiles
8. Launch new profile, go Linkedin.com and log in your account
9. Copy the root folder of your new profile, to do that type about:profiles on your Firefox search bar, copy the root folder C:\---\your-profile-name.
10. Paste the root folder on the `config.py` if the `firefoxProfileRootDir` file
11. Modify/adapt the code and run in `config.py` to preferences.
12. After each run check the jobs that the bot didnâ€™t apply automatically, apply them manually by saving your preferences
13. Next time the bot will apply for more jobs based on your saved preferences on Linkedin.
14. Feel free to contact me for any update/request or question.
